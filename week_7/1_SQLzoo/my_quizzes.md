### Reflection
Oops, I skipped some of the tutorial/ractice questions.  I didn't find SQL terribly difficult, so I decided to skip a few questions.  I wish there were a better interface or program to learn SQL.  SQLZoo wasn't always clear or specific enough.  And the lessons weren't complete.  I had to look up a lot of stuff on my own (using w3schools.com mostly).  But now I know a bit more abour SQL and how it's used, so I shouldn't really complain and just appreciate what I was provided and what I was able to do with what I was provided.  I noticed w3schools.com has "try it yourself" tutorials after their examples.  Maybe we should have just used those?
