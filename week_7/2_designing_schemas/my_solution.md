## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
I am trying to represent a situation in which many students each have their own class schedule.  Class schedules contain information about several classes.  Each class is taught by a particular professor.  I was going to add some sort of counseling/mentoring relationship between students and professors, but I wasn't sure how to depict that just yet.

## Release 5: Reflection
This was sort of a fun challenge, different from the ordinary.  I liked the visual aspect and the ability to re-arrange tables spatially in SQL designer.  It was mostly intuitive in terms of trying to figure out how the program worked. Just from creating the tables and connecting them to one another, I started to get the sense of how difficult/complex it would be to deal with thousands (millioins?) of pieces of information and data.  Looking forward to learning more about databases and databae design!
