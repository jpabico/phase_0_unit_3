This was a good introduction to what I think are the basic commands for creating and altering tables in a database using SQLite3.  It's not that I found it difficult, but I did make a lot of mistakes because of syntax.  I know I need a lot more practice before I get used to SQL.  A lot of the commands are obvious when I read them, but it's the little things
that I keep forgetting to do.  For example, ".exit", not just "exit".  I also keep forgetting to put in the semicolon.  That was something that was always required when I was learning C++.  But being that it's mostly optional in Javascript and Ruby, it's hard to get into the habit of remembering to type it in.
