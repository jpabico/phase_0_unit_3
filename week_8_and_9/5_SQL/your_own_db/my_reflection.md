This was a difficult AND tedious challenge.  But that's partly my fault for creating 4 tables with several fields each and having to add at least 10 entries to a table.  Not that I don't like SQL, but I am getting a distaste for it early in the process.  I'm still confused about certain aspect of the JOIN statement.  For example, when 2 (or more) tables that comprise the JOIN table are each updated (added new field, edited entry, etc), is the JOIN table also updated?  If so, how?  If not, why not?  I maybe should have paired up with someone for this challenge since it took me a while to figure much of this out.  A lot of it was not understanding exactly what needed to be saved (screen shot? text from terminal?) and where (under my_solution? my_schema?).  I definitely need to spend more time on SQL (and databases in general) and will keep that in mind as I progress through DBC.
